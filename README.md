# Awesome-Coding-Exercise-Sites
### A curated list of websites for online coding exercise

This is a list that contains all sites for online coding exercise from [this post on CodeCondo], and others that I found somewhere else. I haven't personally tried them all, but I will. :)

* [topcoder] - You get real money for solving problems. Guess that's why most of them are really difficult.
* [HackerEarth] - A platform for developers to be exposed and get jobs.
* [CodeMonk] - HackerEarth's coding challenges.
* [Project Euler] - Math oriented, classic one. <- "I mean their web design."
* [Daily Programmer] - Reddit's Daily Programmer. Another example of what a classic website looks like.
* [Codility] - Another career platform, and this is their training page.
* [SPOJ] - Stands for Sphere Online Judge. I guess it's the sister of the legendary [Leetcode]?
* [CodeEval] - Another place where programmers can advertise themselves to potential employers.
* [HackerRank] - Another one.
* [Codewars] - The first site of this kind I have ever encountered. Love their web design.
* [Rosalind] - Topics are focused on bioinformatics. But it's still programming.
* [FightCode] - I am pretty sure it's not the same site with the one below.
* [CodeFights] - I am pretty sure it's not the same site with the one above.
* [Codeforces] - Classic.
* [CodinGame] - Practise coding by playing games? I'm so IN!
* [Devdraft] - Yet another one. Really a lot of places to show off ourselves.
* [CodeAbbey] - CLASSIC.
* [IT Test Online] - As the website stated, An "IT Assessment Testing Platform".
* [Checkio] - Another game site. Cute animations.
* [Empire of Code] - A space game for coders. A fun fact: It has the same site icon as Checkio, except for the different colors. Same engine I guess?
* [Exercism]
* [Kaggle]
* [CodeChef]
* [Coderbyte]

Let me know if you have more recommendations.
